A man called ove

Software Requirements:
    Go tools (https://go.dev)
    Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)


Why Go?

    2013 - Go
    1995 - Java 
    1999 - .NET
    Python
    Ruby
    C++
    C

    Reasons:
        1. Ease of packaging & deployment (cloud)
        2. Ease of development
        3. Performance on par with 'C'

    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
            1. No classes (only structs & functions)
            2. No inheritance (only composition)
            3. No access modifiers (public, private, protected)
            4. No exceptions (only errors)
            5. Pointers are supported (But no pointer arithmetic)
            6. Value by default
    2. Performance

    3. Built for concurrency
         go, chan (data type), <- (channel operator), built in scheduler

Paradox of Choice (Barry Schwartz)


func fn(){

}

go fn()

Thread t = new System.Threading.Thread(fn)
t.Start()
    

To run a go program
     go run <program-file-name> 

To create a build
     go build <program-file-name> 
     OR
     go build -o <binary-name> <program-file-name> 


Data Types

    string
    bool

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real [float32] + imaginary [float32])
    complex128 (real [float64] + imaginary [float64])

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (represents a unicode code point)

Assignment-1
Write a program that will print all the prime numbers between 3 to 100

Assignment-2
Display the following menu 
		1. Add
		2. Subtract
		3. Multiply
		4. Divide
		5. Exit
    If the user choice is 1 - 4, 
		accept 2 numbers 
		perform the operation
		print the result
		display the menu again
	if the user choice is 5
		exit from the application
	If the user enters any other choice 
		display "Invalid choice" 
		display the menu again.

Assignment-3
    Refactor the assignment-2 solution using functions

Functions
    1. Anonymous functions
    2. Variadic functions
    3. Higher order functions
        a. functions can be assigned to variables
        b. functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        c. functions can be returned by other functions
    4. handling errors
    5. deferred functions
    6. panic & recovery

Collections
    1. Array
        Fixed size
    2. Slice
        Wrapper for an array
        Variable size
    3. Map
        key/value collection

Modularity
    Before go 1.13
        GOPATH
            bin
                go tool binaries
            pkg
                third party packages
            src
                github.com
                    tkmagesh
                        myApp1
                            pk1
                            pk2
                                import "github.com/tkmagesh/myApp1/pk1"

    Module
        myApp
            go.mod
            main.go
                import modulename/pkg1

            /pk1
                f1.go
                f2.go
            /pkg
                f1.go
                f2.go

    to create a module
        go mod init <module-name>

    to install 3rd party modules
        go get <module-name>

    to localize the dependencies
        go mod vendor

    to install tools
        go install <package-name>

    
Duck Typing
    If you have an object that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, you can treat is as a duck even though it is NOT a duck

Concurrency:
    Never ASSUME the order in which the goroutines will be executed
    A function that has to be executed as goroutine CANNOT have any return values

    To detect race conditions
        go run --race <program.go>

    Channel Operations ( <- operator )
        ch := make(chan int) //creating the channel
        ch <- 10            // writing
        result := <- ch     // reading

        All read operations are blocking operations

        
    Types of Channels
        Non Buffered
        Buffered

        Non Buffered
            A write operation will be blocked until a read operation is initiated

Assignment:9
    Modify the demo-14.go to generate the even numbers until the user hits the ENTER key

IO
    io package
        base interfaces
            Reader
            Writer
            Closer
            Seeker
    ioutil package
        read file
        write file

    bufio package
        read line
        buffered reading & writing

    os package
        file related operations
            creating, copying, deleting
